# Tensorflow_PDE
Experimental approach of solving ODE using Tensorflow
In the script ODE.py I numerically solve the eqation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y'=\frac{sin(x)}{(x%2By%2B1)}" width="100"> on the interval [0..10]
Launch Comparison.py to see performance of BDF, DormandPrince and Scipy ode solver comparison

In the script PDE.py I numerically solve first-order PDE with known analytical solution.
