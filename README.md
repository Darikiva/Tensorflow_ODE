# Tensorflow_ODE
Experimental approach of solving ODE using Tensorflow
In this toy example I am trying to numerically solve the eqation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y'=\frac{sin(x)}{(x%2By%2B1)}" width="100"> on the interval [0..10]

Launch Comparison.py to see performance of BDF, DormandPrince and Scipy ode solver comparison
